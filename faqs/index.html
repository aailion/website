<h2 id="what-should-i-bring-to-my-childs-evaluation">What should I bring to my child’s evaluation?</h2>
<p>If your child needs any visual or hearing aids, you should let the clinician know and bring them with you to the evaluation. It is also helpful to provide the clinician with any previous evaluations (even if completed at a young age), as well as school records, including assessments, report cards, and Individual Education Programs (IEPs). If your child takes medication, it is helpful to let the clinician know in advance, and to make sure your child takes their medication as prescribed on the day of testing.</p>
<h2 id="what-happens-after-testing-is-completed">What happens after testing is completed?</h2>
<p>Shortly following the feedback session, the family (and the child, if requested by the parent(s) or guardian(s)) will receive a detailed report outlining the results of the testing, as well as diagnostic impressions and associated recommendations.</p>
<p>Neuropsychologists often continue to work collaboratively with parents and other members of a child’s treatment team following the evaluation. For example, the neuropsychologist may share the report with members of the child’s treatment and education team, and may conduct follow-up consultations to answer any questions about the results or the report. Additionally, for an additional fee the neuropsychologists may participate in school and/or IEP meetings, or they refer families to educational advocates and consultants, depending on the family’s wishes.</p>
