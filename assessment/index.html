<h2 id="neuropsychological-evaluation">Neuropsychological Evaluation</h2>
<p>Neuropsychological assessment involves multiple methods of investigation and examines biological, psychological, and contextual factors in producing a comprehensive assessment of functioning. Testing usually includes review of medical or school records, clinical interview, and psychometric testing. It concludes with a feedback session during which we will discuss your results.</p>
<p>A neuropsychological evaluation is a test to measure how well a person&rsquo;s brain is working. We use up-to-date, standard measures to develop a detailed profile of learning strengths and weaknesses. Our goal is to understand how your child learns best and gain insight into how he processes information and handles tasks compared to other children of the same age.</p>
<p>We carefully review your child’s skills and abilities in many domains, including intellectual functioning and reasoning abilities, learning and memory, visual processing, listening comprehension and verbal expression, and executive skills like planning, organizing, and managing time and materials, attention, and concentration. These are the skills and abilities that are at the core of all aspects of academic achievement. Because of the detailed nature of these evaluations, testing can take up to 6 hrs. The evaluation can be spread over 2 days, if desired.</p>
<h2 id="psychoeducational-evaluation">Psychoeducational Evaluation</h2>
<p>We administer reading, math and writing tests to see what school skills your child has mastered. We carefully observe how he approaches each task and we look at their patterns of performance to see if a learning disability affects their ability to demonstrate what they know. We don’t give every child the same tests, but rather use our assessment tools to develop a profile of each child’s individual learning strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<h2 id="fees--health-insurance-coverage">Fees &amp; Health Insurance Coverage</h2>
<p>A comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation is $5,000 including interview, testing, feedback of results, and comprehensive integrated neuropsychological report with diagnoses and recommendations. Insurance is not accepted, however, our services are reimbursable by most insurers. For additional services, such as diagnostic interview, classroom observation, or school consultation please please contact our office.
